# DESCRIPTION OF MY WORK.
* My Name is Aman Bassi, and I am a graduate student pursuing my master's in field of Artificial Intelligence and databases. My current GPA is 3.9
---
> Firstly, I want to tell pertaining to my relevant Coursework in University of Texas at Arlington.
---
* #### RELEVANT COURSEWORK
1. #### DAMT(DATA ANALYSIS and Modelling Techniques): 
    This course was totally based on Probability and statistics.
---
2. #### Neural Networks: 
    In This course, I learnt different kind of Neural Networks and implemented different rules associated with it.
    like **hebbian learning rule**, **Perceptron learning Rule**, **Convolution Neural Networks**, **Backpropogation Algorithm on mnist data using Tensorflow**, **Widrow-huff Learning Rule(Basically Stock predictor)**, **Adaptive filter ADALINE**, **Using pretrained model like Facenet to do face Recognition**.
---
3. #### Machine Learning:
   In this Course, I learnt **Naive Bayes Text Classification** on 20 newsgroup data, **Linear Regression**, **K-means clustering on Iris dataset**.
---
4. #### Big Data:
   In this Course, I learnt how to deal when we have lot of data using Apache Spark, Hive, Pig, Storm, Map-Reduce.
   ** my final Project ** in this course was to do real time data processing from Twitter and display the count of most popular hashtags using Apache Storm.

5. #### Data Mining:
    In this Course, I learnt a lot pertaining to the algorithms liks Kmeans, k-centroid, knn and feature selection
    and implemented projects on these things on different datasets like digits, NBA dataset, Iris dataset.
    
### These were the most relevant courses in terms of Artificial Intelligence and analysing data.

# Work with Dr.Neelabh:
I worked with Neelabh on a project which is involving one of the users spatial-temporal data in which I converted a Kml file to a database by extracting relevant information from that Kml file and storing it in databases and then reducing the data dimensions using Hilbert and Z-order curve algorithms and then seeing the distributions of that data and then removing the outliers from that data using different techniques and comparing results and then applying neural network over it to predict the user location.

Apart from this, I am learning Tableau these days, developing my own Website

Languages I am most comfortable with are *Python*, *Matlab*, *Javascript*, *Java*.
